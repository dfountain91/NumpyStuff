    "<h3>An example of solving for distance between all points in an array:</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "What we want here is to take an array, X, filled with points in 2-d and get the distance from each point to every other point. While we could use for-loops numpy lets us do this in parallel quickly. So we know numpy has the tools, unfortunately school tells us how to solve certain problems, not which problems apply to which realities. That's where practice and tutorials like this come in handy. So lets formalize the problem into something Numpy can solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want $X[i]-X[j]$ for all i,j in range(0,number of rows). This gives us the distance between every point in an array. But there are 2 problems we have to solve: how do we store this information, and how do we perform this operation in parallel? Well we know Numpy can do component-wise operations in parallel, so the question is how do we make the components 'line up' so we can simply execute A-B for some A and some B? This is where broadcasting comes to the rescue!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take this step by step. $X[i]-X[j]$ in Numpy is implicitly $X[i][k]-X[j][k]$. So let's try and run this naively. "

    "So what happened here? Well clearly we didn't index over $i$ and $j$ separately. By using ':' inside the index for the first access we told numpy to access every row in order, and then subtract from that every row <i>also in order</i>. Clearly we need a way to make $i$ line up with every $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this would generate a new array for every combination of i, j, and k. Since we have 3 indicies we know our storage object needs to similarly be accessed by 3 indicies, lest we leave some results inaccessible. For now we ignore the symmetry of the problem. So lets choose to store it in a 3d array called $D$. Keep in mind this is a <i>choice</i> we could have stored it in some python object or some dataframe equally well. \n",
    "\n",
    "So given we've chosen a 3d array and an operation $X[i][k]-X[j][k]$ we must map this into $D[i][j][k]$. One observation we can make is that j does not affect our first term and i does not affect our second term. So for the first term, this means if we 'duplicate' X along a new axis we can get $X[i][j][k] = X[i][k]$ for all i,j,k. Similarly this also allows us to get $X[i][j][k] = X[j][k]$ for all i,j,k. "
